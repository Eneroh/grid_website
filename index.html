					<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
						<p>You are viewing my attempt at a professional webpage. If you were unaware, I am basing this 
						upon <a href="https://csszengarden.com/">csszengarden.</a>
						What you will see within the link provided are similarities but also changes that will accommodate 
						my lack of knowledge in html, css and javascript. But still these changes look pretty snazzy.
						If you are hoping for a copy of my html and css documents. Good luck lol, if you're capable you're probs 
						better off reading it through inspect element.</p>

					<br><h1>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h1>
							<p>Here I will repeat much of the same. I think within this section, I will try and provide more information 
							on why I have decided to create this. Yes, I will do this by creating a list. <i>*ahem*</i>
							<p><i>Reasons why I have decided to create a website</i></p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Boredom</p></li>
							<li><p>I have too much time on my hands</p></li>
							<li><p>Gain more knowledge in something that interests me</p></li>
							<li>To show-off (obviously)</li>

					<h1>WHY THE COLOR SCHEME?</h1>
					...Why not? lol.
					But I have chosen dark blue, light purplish blue, grey and black and white because it's really difficult to find a good
					palette. So I based the color design on a previous website I made during my I.T. courses. Also the colors I like the calmer
					colors.
